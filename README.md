# Simple-API-Swift
Just an example of an application that uses a simple API, which generates random users.
This functional application allows you to create random users through a relatively user-friendly API. It serves as a good example to familiarize yourself with decoding the data required to utilize the data stream provided by any API. This application example was shown to me by [Matthieu Passerel](https://www.udemy.com/user/matthieu-passerel/), a trainer on Udemy, during an exercise to which I added a few enhancements to better understand how data can be associated later on. It provides a solid understanding of structuring data from an API and can serve as a starting point for learning about more complex APIs in the future. Feel free to use this foundation for practice and to gain a better understanding of how everything works. I have added some annotations in the code to guide you on the functionality and purpose of certain functions, ViewControllers, etc. The provided assets are royalty-free thanks to Pexels.
